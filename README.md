# BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub
BC Developers' Policy and Guideline Documents - All the information a BC Government employee could ever want about [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov).

***
The BCGov GitHub Organization represents an ongoing effort to enable public & private sector developers, as well as citizen developers, the ability to collaborate on, leverage and integrate technology assets outside of the typical government procurement/contract model.

This repo's content is focused on providing information, examples and guidelines to facilitate the creation and governance of BCGov Open Source projects. We don't want to duplicate the good work GitHub has done with their own [online guides](https://guides.github.com/). Our focus is giving BC Government people and projects the information they need to get started on GitHub while remaining compliant with BC standards and policies.

## Features

The document content, templates and guides are organized into two categories ("Employee Guide" and "How To"). These are best accessed using the contents section provided under these navigation files:

# [Employee Guide](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/README.md)
# [How To's](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/README.md)


There is also a handy ["Cheatsheet"](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Cheatsheet.md) for quick access to key policies and to-do's for BC Government people working in GitHub.


## Project Status
November 2015: We have arrived at the delivery phase of the project now that we have been given sign off from the BC Government Chief Information Officer on the Employee Guide contents of this repository. That means we are starting the process of operationalizing our Org activities here on GitHub :)

Right now we are helping some early adopter projects get existing code up on GitHub. If are asking yourself "I wonder if my project code could be added to GitHub?" there is a great resource on OSS-Watch that walks you through an [openness rating checklist](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/openness/).

If you are starting a brand new project - you came to the right place! This repo will get you going in the right direction.
